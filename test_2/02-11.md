Pointers, Part II
=================

``` c
int i = 10;
int* pi = &i;
printf("%d", pi); // Would print mem address in pi
printf("%d", *pi); // Would print 10, dereferenced pi

int i2[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
int* pi2 = &i2;
pi2++; // Increments pi2 by 4 bytes (because sizeof(int) == 4)
// address of 0th element of array is just name of array
int* pi3 = i2; // Proper form instead of having & sign:
```
