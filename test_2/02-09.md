Typdefs and pointers

``` c
typedef int my_thing; // Allows for easy changing of type later on
typedef strcut
{
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;
    char ch;
} my_struct_t

my_struct_t x;
// Sub element initialization
x.a = 10;
x.b = 20;
x.c = 30;
x.ch = 'a';

// 4 bit boundaries, last two bits = 0

(*x).a;
x->a;

function(&bla) // pass address or pointer to bla

```
* Can pass structs into functions, but copy is made when struct is passed
* Need a pointer to the struct in order to pass
